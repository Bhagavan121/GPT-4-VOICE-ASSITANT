# GPT-4-VOICE-ASSITANT

AI-Powered Voice Assistant

Overview:

This AI-powered voice assistant integrates OpenAI's GPT-4 API with speech-to-text (Whisper) and text-to-speech (gTTS) to enable natural language conversations. 
It can execute system commands, provide real-time information, and respond to contextual queries.

Features:

->Speech Recognition: Uses OpenAI's Whisper to convert spoken input into text.

->AI Response: Utilizes OpenAI's GPT-4 to generate responses.

->Text-to-Speech: Converts AI responses to speech using gTTS.

->Command Execution: Can perform system operations like opening applications.

->Real-Time Information: Fetches live data (e.g., weather, news) based on queries.

How It Works:

->The assistant listens to user input via the microphone.

->Converts speech to text using Whisper.

->Sends the text to OpenAI's GPT-4 for a response.

->Converts the response back to speech using gTTS.

->Plays the generated audio response.

Customization
Modify the command execution feature to add more system operations.

Integrate weather APIs or other services for enhanced real-time responses.

Improve natural language understanding by fine-tuning prompt engineering.
